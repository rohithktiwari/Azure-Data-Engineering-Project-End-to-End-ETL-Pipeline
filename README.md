# Building an End-to-End Data Engineering Solution with Azure ‚ú®

In this blog, I share a comprehensive guide to designing an end-to-end (E2E) data engineering pipeline using Azure's powerful tools. The project processes, transforms, and delivers data for Business Intelligence (BI) purposes, leveraging resources like Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Power BI. The data source is the **AdventureWorks dataset**, fetched directly from GitHub. Here‚Äôs how the solution is structured:

## **Architecture Overview**

### **Step 1: Setting Up the Azure Environment** ‚öôÔ∏è

To start, the following Azure resources were provisioned:

- **Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Used for data orchestration and automation.
- **Azure Storage Account:** Acts as the data lake, storing raw (bronze), transformed (silver), and curated (gold) data.
- **Azure Databricks:** Performs data transformations and computations.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics:** Handles data warehousing for BI use.

All resources were configured with proper Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to ensure seamless integration and security.

### **Step 2: Implementing the Data Pipeline Using ADF** üöÄ

**Azure Data Factory (ADF)** serves as the backbone for orchestrating the data pipeline.

1. **Dynamic Copy Activity:**
   - ADF pulls data from GitHub using an HTTP connector and stores it in the bronze container in Azure Storage.
   - Parameters were added to the pipeline for adaptability to changes in the data source.

The raw data is now securely stored and ready for transformation.

### **Step 3: Data Transformation with Azure Databricks** üîÑ

Using Azure Databricks, the raw data from the bronze container was transformed into a structured format.

#### Key Steps:
- **Cluster Setup:** A Databricks cluster was created to process the data efficiently.
- **Data Lake Integration:** Databricks connected to Azure Storage to access the raw data.

#### Transformations:
- Normalized date formats for consistency.
- Cleaned and filtered invalid or incomplete records.
- Grouped and concatenated data to make it more usable for analysis.
- Saved the transformed data in the silver container in Parquet format for optimal storage and query performance.

### **Step 4: Data Warehousing with Azure Synapse Analytics** üìä

Azure Synapse Analytics structured the processed data for analysis and BI reporting.

#### Steps:
1. **Connection to Silver Container:** Configured Synapse to query data directly from Azure Storage.
2. **Serverless SQL Pools:** Enabled querying without provisioning upfront resources.
3. **Database and Schema Creation:**
   - Created SQL databases and schemas to organize data.
   - Defined external tables and views for BI consumption.

The cleaned, structured data was then moved to the gold container for reporting purposes.

### **Step 5: Business Intelligence Integration** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The final step involved integrating the data with a BI tool to visualize and generate insights.

- **Power BI Integration:**
   - Connected Power BI to Azure Synapse Analytics.
   - Designed dashboards and reports to present actionable insights to stakeholders.
